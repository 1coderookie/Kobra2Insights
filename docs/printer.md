# Printer
The Anycubic [**Kobra 2**](https://store.anycubic.com/products/kobra-2) is a high speed FDM bedslinger style printer.  
It comes pre-assembled, you only have to mount a few parts like the 'upstanding' frame onto the base frame.  

See [Anycubic's support page](https://www.anycubic.com/pages/firmware-software) of the Kobra 2 series to find manuals, firmware, video tutorials and more or use the direct links in the following.

## Box Content

The printer comes partially preassembled and well packed in one big box.  
Since I don't have a picture of the Kobra 2 in a box, let me show you the Kobra 2 Pro instead - the content and spare parts are pretty much the same.

Along with the printer come some additional parts, like a sample of PLA, a USB drive, some tools, a spare nozzle and so on. You can see these items in the following picture.
